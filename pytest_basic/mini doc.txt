Rules to run pytest:-
1. All test files must start with test_ or end with _test
2. All tests should be written inside python methods
3. Every method should begin with test_
4. Method name should have sense
5. Class name should begin with Test

Pytest tags:-

# you can mark groups by using @pytest.mark.tagName
# you can skip a particular method by @pytest.mark.skip
# @pytest.mark.xfail -> this will run the method but does not show whether the test passed or fail
                   -> this is used when we know that the test will fail, but we need the operations of that 
                   method for subsequent test-cases
# @pytest.fixture(scope=<scope>, params = []):-
    this will make the method to be used before and/or after a particular test method (see test_fixtureDemo.py)
# conftest -> basically contains method wrapped with @pytest.fixture(scope=<scope>)
           -> It is similar to Listener in testng


Running Pytest from terminal:-

1. inorder to run all the test files from cmd using pytest use -> py.test -v -s
2. Run a specific test file -> py.test fileName -v -s
3. Run only specific methods that matches a given regular expression: py.test -k regex -v -s
4. you can mark (tags/groups) test cases using @pytest.mark.tagName and use -m tagName to run those
              -> py.test -m tagName -v -s
5. Generate html report -> pytest --html=report.html



-k -> for method name execution using pattern matching with a regex
-v -> verbose => more info
-s -> show thw logs
-m -> run the mark of given tagName
